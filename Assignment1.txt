Answer for Assignment Part-1:

Ans1: Python is said general purpose programming lang because we can use python to develop all sorts of application
	(websites, AI, ML,Data Science,Data Engineering, business softwares) thats why Python is widely used.
	High Level Lang means that the lang will have abstraction from details of the computer i.e we dont use machine
	code and assembly lang. And being a programmer we should not worry about low level activities like memory and securtiy management.
	Python is high level lang as well why because its not compiled language but an interpreted dynamic lang, its like normal
	english and it is easily readible. 

Ans2: Python is called dynamically typed lang becuase we dont have to explicitly defined the data type of the var.
	In other lang suppose we have to declare a float type var then we have to define float as a data type but in
	python we dont define data type of the var.

Ans3: Pros:
	Python has all almost all programming features from all programming languages i.e functional programming from C
	OOPs from C++ and Java, Scripting from Pearl and shell script, modular from Modula 3
	Python can be used everywhere, even NASA, Google, NYSE, Youtube and all top companies use Python.
	Simple and easy to learn like english lang.
	Its freeware and open source.
	Platform independent, I mean we can run python program in any system without rewriting again.
	It has extensive library.
	Its embedded, we can use python program in any other lang programs.

	Cons:
	Performance is not upto the mark becaus its interpreted lang.
	We can't use Python for creating mobile application.

Ans4: We can use python everywhere and in all domain like data engineering,AI, ML and in data science field.

Ans5: Variable is nothing but a reserved memory location where we store values. Suppose we have variable called 
	a which stores an integer, so in that case a 4 bytes of memory will be reserved to store an integer value.
	We declare a variable using naming convention like a=10. We cant use 33 reserved keywords for decalring a variable.
	We cant declare a variable like 123a=10. We should keep convention in our mind before declare any variable.


Ans 6: To take input from use we have input() method so whatever input we give it will be treated as string type so 
	 we need to do typecasting before processing as per our requirement.
	 e.g- a= int(input("enter a number")) -> as we enter a number so we had to typecast it into int type.

Ans7: The default data type of the value that has been taken  from the user as an input is String type.

Ans8: Type casting is a way to convert a data type into another data type.

Ans9: Yes we can take more than one input from user using single input () method by using list comprehension.

	a,b= [int(x) for x in input("Enter 2 numbers :").split()] 

	note: here split() function can take space as a default separator but we can take anything as a separtoor

Ans 10: Keywords in python are reserved words which is 33 in total. we cant use those reserved ketwords to define a
	  variable name or function.

Ans 11: No we cant use keywords as a vraiable because these are predefine for synatx of coding.

Ans 12: Indentation is nothing but the spaces in the begining of any statement in our code which is used to define
	  the block of the code and if the statement in our code is having same alignment then its called a suite.

Ans 13: So to throw some output in python we use print() function.

Ans 14: Operators is something which do some operation, and to do some operations Python provides set of operators.
	  Arithmetic operator,logical opeartor,bitwise operator,assignment operator.

Ans15: / will give output in flaot and // will give output in int.

Ans 16: input = 'ineuron'
	  output = input *4
	  print(output)

Ans 17: 

a = int(input("enter a number"))
if a %2 ==0:
    print("number is even")
else:
    print("number is odd")

Ans 18: boolean is an operator to represent the expression to be either true or false.

Ans 19: 1 or 0 ---> 1, because 1 is consider true and 0 is false and if we apply or then it will give true.
	  0 and 0 ---> 0
        True and False and True--> False
	  1 or 0 or 0---> 1


Ans 20: if, if-else, if-elif-else are the conditional statement in python.

Ans 21: if is used whether the particukar statement is true or false. I mean if some statement is true then execute 
        the later part.
	  elif means even if previous statement is not true then also execute the statments.
	  else is like optional and it will only run when if and elif returns false 

Ans 22: 

age= int(input("enter age"))
if age >= 18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I cant vote")

Ans 23: 
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
print(numbers)
sum=0
for i in numbers:
    if i %2==0:
        sum=sum+i
print(sum)
        

Ans 24: 

a= int(input("enter first number"))
b= int(input("enter second number"))
c= int(input("enter third number"))

max= a if a >b and a>c else b if b>c else c
print("greatest number is ",max)

Ans 25:

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

for i in numbers:
    if i %5==0 and i > 150:
        continue
    elif i > 500:
        break
print(i)
